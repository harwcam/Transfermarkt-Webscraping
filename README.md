# Transfermarkt-Webscraping
This is code I created to introduce myself to the BeautifulSoup module.

In this code I define functions to scrape transfer activity & player images from European soccer clubs. While there are many ways to analyze and visualize this data, such as net-spend analysis between clubs,
I chose to plot Manchester United's highest transfer fees per season.
